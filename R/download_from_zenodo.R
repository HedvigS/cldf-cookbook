#Script was written by Hedvig Skirg√•rd
#This script downloads datasets from zenodo that have been released via github, exemplfiying with grambank as the zenodo URL, but you can insert any valid Zenodo download URL.


#if you need to download something like grambank-analysed which has inside of it other datasets, look at this script: https://github.com/OlenaShcherbakova/Sociodemographic_factors_complexity/blob/main/get_external_data.R

#loading packages
if (!suppressPackageStartupMessages(require("pacman"))) { install.packages("pacman") } #if pacman isn't already installed, install it.
