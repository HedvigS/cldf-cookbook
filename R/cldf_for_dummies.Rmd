### CLDF for dummies

This document outlines some of the very basics of the Cross-Linguistic Data Format (CLDF). CLDF is a way of organising language data, in particular datasets with many different languages in it. The basic organisation is a set of csv-sheets (languages.csv, forms.csv etc). These documents are linked to each other in a specific way which makes it possible to combine them into a interlinked database. At the same time, because they are just plain csv-sheets so they can easily be read in by most data analysis software programs like python, R, julia etc or just regular spreadsheet programs like LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel. It is not necessary to use FileMakerPro, Microsoft Access or similar programs.

It's plain, flat and simple and you can get the hang of it in a jiffy! In this document, you will learn the very basics on how it works and how to read them in.

The data format was first published in 2018 [1] and has since then expanded to include a large amount of different datasets.

### How to know if you're dealing with a CLDF-dataset

You are dealing with a CLDF-dataset if there is a folder called "cldf" with files like "languages.csv", "values.csv" and "StructureDataset-metadata.json" in it. The last file will be different depending on the type of dataset.

Here are some examples of datasets that are available in CLDF-format that you may have encountered:

-   WALS (World Atlas of Language Structures)

-   PHOIBLE (Phonetics Information Base and Lexicon)

-   D-PLACE (Database of Places, Language, Culture and Environment)

-   Glottolog

-   Lexibank

-   Grambank

    ### Types of CLDF-datasets

There are five types of CLDF-datasets. They are also known as "modules".

-   Wordlist (lexicon, has Forms and often Cognates)
-   Structure dataset (grammar or other types of information with one value for a Parameter and a Feature, has Values)
-   Dictionary (particular kind of lexicon, has Entries and Senses)
-   Parallel text (collections of paragraphs of the same text in different languages, has Forms, Segments and FunctionalEquivalents)
-   generic (no specific type)

## Contents

Each CLDF-dataset consists of a set of tables, a bibTeX-file and a json-file. The tables are usually in csv-format and contain the data itself, the json file has information about the dataset. The bibTeX-file contains bibliographic references for the data. Each data-point is tied to a reference by the key in the bibTeX entry.

## Tables inside datasets

There are some tables that occurr in all CLDF-datasets, and some that occurr only in certain types. For example, there is no table with words for Structure datasets - that's for wordlists and Dictionaries.

The tables have specific names in the CLDF-world. The names are different from their filenames. You can see which name is tied to which csv-file in the json. For example, "LanguageTable" is usually found in the file languages.csv.

#### Tables in most CLDF-dataset

Here are CLDF-tables that occur in most CLDF-datasets

-   LanguageTable - list of all of the languages in the dataset. May also include things classified by Glottolog as dialects or proto-languages. Includes meta-information like longitude, language family etc.
-   ParameterTable - contains a definition of the variables. For lexicon, these are the concepts, for grammar these are the features.

Wordlist also contain

-   FormTable - the forms for each concept for each language
-   CognateTable (not obligatory) - the cognate classification per form per concept per language

Structure datasets also contain
-   ValueTable - the value for each Parameter and language
-   CodeTable - The list of possible values for each parameter. For example, GB020 in Grambank is a binary feature and can take 0, 1 and ? whereas EA016 in the Ethnographic Atlas (D-PLACE) can take 1, 2 or 9. The options are exclusive of each other for each data-point.

##### Example: Wordlist

Below is a tiny Wordlist dataset. This dataset contains 3 words in 2 languages. The first two tables, LanguageTable and ParameterTable contains information about the languages and parameters - in this case concepts. The FormTable contains the actual forms. For one of the concepts, one of the language has two words and both are listed.

**LanguageTable**

One row = one language (or sometimes dialect or proto-language, i.e above language in a tree). The ID column uniquely identifies each language in the dataset. In other tables, the linking column is called "Language_ID".

| ID  | Name     | Glottocode |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 15  | Bintulu  | bint1246   |
| 18  | CHamorro | cham1312   |

**ParameterTable**

One row = one parameter. The ID column uniquely identifies each parameter in the dataset. In other tables, the linking column is called "Parameter_ID".

| ID         | Name    | Concepticon_ID |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 144_toburn | to burn | 2102           |
| 2_left     | left    | 244            |

**FormTable**

One row = one form. The ID column uniquely identifies each form in the dataset. In other tables, the linking column is called "Form_ID". Here we also see Parameter_ID, which links to the column ID in the ParameterTable and Language_ID which linkes to the column ID in the LanguageTable.

| ID              | Parameter_ID | Language_ID | Form   | Source        |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 15-144_toburn-1 | 144_toburn   | 15          | pegew  | Blust-15-2005 |
| 15-144_toburn-2 | 144_toburn   | 15          | tinew  | Blust-15-2005 |
| 18-2_left       | 2_left       | 18          | akague | 38174         |

**Source**

bibTeX file called "sources.bib" One entry = one source.

```         
@misc{Blust-15-2005,
    author = {Blust},
    date = {2005},
    howpublished = {personal communication}
}

@book{38174,
    author = {Topping, Donald M. and Ogo, Pedro M. and Dungca, Bernadita C.},
    address = {Honolulu},
    publisher = {The University Press of Hawaii},
    title = {Chamorro-English dictionary},
    year = {1975}
}
```

##### Example: Structure

-   ValueTable - contains all of the data-points, be they cognate classes, grammatical feature values etc
