# cldf-cookbook

This is a collection of code (Python and R) which I use for particular purposes.

* `create_tree_bottom_up.py` is a short script which takes a list of glottocodes for a given family in glottolog and outputs the subtree which contains all of those glottocodes as tips and no other 
* `R/Worldmap_plotting.R` is a longer script which plots points on a pacific-centered worldmap. It is exemplified with langoids from glottolog as points colored for MED or Family_ID, but can be adaopted for other purposes
